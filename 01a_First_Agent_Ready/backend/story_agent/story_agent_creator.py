Your Story:
[SCENE 1]
Sir Reginald, the bravest knight in all the land, polished his shining armor. His heart was set on a great adventure, and he dreamed of tales he would tell for years to come. He lived in a cozy cottage at the edge of the Enchanted Forest, a place of wonder and mystery.

[SCENE 2]
One day, a villager rushed to Sir Reginald, out of breath. "A dragon!" he cried. "A fearsome dragon has been spotted in the Enchanted Forest!". Sir Reginald knew at once that this was his quest. He grabbed his sword and shield and marched into the forest.

[SCENE 3]
Deep in the forest, Sir Reginald found the dragon. But the dragon was not fearsome. It was a baby dragon, and it was crying because it was lost. The dragon had big, sad, purple eyes. Sir Reginald put down his sword and offered the dragon a friendly smile.

[SCENE 4]
Sir Reginald helped the baby dragon find its way back to its family. The mother dragon was so grateful that she gave Sir Reginald a magical, glowing scale. From that day on, Sir Reginald was known not just as the bravest knight, but also as the kindest.
